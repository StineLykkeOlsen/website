  <div class="post-content"><div>
        <p>In short, my role as a technical writer is to communicate technical information to various audiences.</p>
<p>As a tech writer I use a variety of tools in my day-to-day work to convey information to the end user in an applicable and comprehensible way. These tools include version control systems, XML’s, and text processing programs, such as GitHub, DITA XML, and Microsoft Word.</p>
<p>My experience with technical communication consists of writing, editing, and translating technical SEO web content, software and hardware documentation, user manuals, grant proposals, and other types of information. My areas of expertise as a tech writer are software, science, hardware, and medicine.</p>
<p>Among the services that I offer are technical writing and editing, coding, user experience design, and data analysis. I provide companies and organizations with, among other things:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; User manuals 
&gt; Product descriptions
&gt; Installation guides 
&gt; Fact sheets
&gt; Category texts
&gt; Technical SEO web content
&gt; Grant proposals
&gt; Software documentation
&gt; UX Writing
</code></pre>
<p>To deliver optimal results I may conducts interviews with developers, product owners, designers, and others. My strength as a skilled technical writer is a comprehensive technical knowledge combined with strong writing skills. This enables me to serve as link between experts and developers on the one hand and end users and audiences on the other hand.</p>
<h1 id="my-approach-to-technical-writing">My Approach to Technical Writing<a href="#my-approach-to-technical-writing" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>Docs like Code. Structured Writing. ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English. These are all terms that float around the field of technical writing. Each of these terms cover different methods applied and practiced by tech writers. Each method has its merits and strengths depending on the subject matter of the content, the end user, the scope of the content, and the values and guidelines of the company or organization behind the text.</p>
<p>As a tech writer I am flexible regarding the methods based on the nature of the task at hand. Regardless of the methods, my approach to technical writing is based on four pragmatic rules:</p>
<pre><code>1. Keep the end user in mind – a tech writer should be the reader’s advocate 
2. Stay true to the values, mission, and internal guidelines of the sender
3. Keep it clear – explain one aspect at the time in a clear language
4. Technical texts can still be enjoyable - even though the topics are complex 
</code></pre>
<p>In short, I always strive to deliver well written, great technical content that focuses on the needs of the end user without loosing sight of the goals of the sender organization.</p>
<h1 id="tools-and-technologies">Tools and technologies<a href="#tools-and-technologies" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>A tech writer applies various tools when producing documentation and other types of text. I have experience with the following technologies and programming languages:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; Git and GitHub
&gt; DITA XML
&gt; Memsource (and other CAT Tools)
&gt; Microsoft Word
&gt; Microsoft Access 
&gt; Markdown
&gt; VS Code
&gt; Hugo
&gt; JavaScript
&gt; Python (Including PyCharm and Anaconda)
