        <p>My journey towards becoming a technical writer and translator started in 2005 when I had my first job editing and proof reading a translation for a Danish First Aid Company. For the last couple of decades I have worked as a translator, writer, and language teacher. In 2022, however, I decided to take the leap and become an independent technical writer and translator.</p>
<p>My goal is to help companies and organizations optimize their technical communication by providing great technical content. In my personal and professional life I strive to adhere to my core values:</p>
<pre><code># Be quality conscious

# Be reliable and trustworthy

# Be genuine, respectful, and kind
</code></pre>
<p>I have successfully helped companies and organizations in the health software, first aid, educational, and technical hardware sectors with technical writing and translation tasks. They include:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; Proof reading, editing, and quality management

&gt; Communication strategy and planning

&gt; SEO and technical copywriting

&gt; Translation of medical software

&gt; Subtitling 

&gt; Hardware documentation

&gt; Proposal writing for EU projects
</code></pre>
<p>Formally, I hold a master’s degree in Chinese and German Studies, and I have spent years teaching and translating these languages.</p>
<p>As a tech writer, however, I mostly work with the language combination English – Danish.</p>
<p>When I am not trying to coordinate the chaotic hubbub that is everyday life with a husband and two children, I am an avid practitioner of aikido, archery, and open water swimming.</p>
