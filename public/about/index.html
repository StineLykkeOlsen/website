<p>I am a tech writer and technical translator living and working in Odder, Central Denmark.</p>
<p>I have built this website with a two-fold purpose:</p>
<p>to showcase my professional experiences and skills; and</p>
<p>to delve into my philosophy towards writing and translation - and the importance of high-quality technical communication.</p>
<p>It is my goal to help companies and organizations optimize their technical communication by providing great technical content.</p>
<p>I have successfully helped companies and organizations in the health software, first aid, educational, and technical hardware sectors with technical writing and translation tasks.</p>
<p>These include:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; Proof reading, editing, and quality management

&gt; Communication strategy and planning

&gt; SEO and technical copywriting

&gt; Translation of medical software

&gt; Subtitling 

&gt; Hardware documentation

&gt; Proposal writing for EU projects
</code></pre>
<p>Formally, I hold a master’s degree in Chinese and German Studies and have spent years teaching and translating these languages.</p>
<p>As a tech writer, however, I mostly work with the language combination English – Danish.</p>
<p>When I am not trying to coordinate the chaotic hubbub that is everyday life with a husband and two children, I am an avid practitioner of aikido, archery, and open water swimming.</p>
