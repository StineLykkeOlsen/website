To showcase my qualifications, writing skills, and employment history, I am present on the usual channels on the web. 

# Medium

I have chosen **Medium** as the ... well, medium ... for my portfolio, since it is gorgeous and much quicker to update than this static Hugo site. 

On my [Medium profile](https://medium.com/@stinelykkeolsen) I share writing samples and articles on technical communication, languages, UX design, and coding. 
Most of the content I write is owned by my clients, so my portfolio only shows a part of the things I have written.
