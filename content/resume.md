# Portfolio
I have chosen [Medium](https://medium.com/@stinelykkeolsen) as the ... well, medium ... for my portfolio. It is gorgeous and much quicker to update than this static Hugo site. 

There, I share writing samples and articles on technical communication, languages, UX design, and coding. 
Most of the content I write is owned by my clients, so my portfolio only shows a part of the things I have written.
