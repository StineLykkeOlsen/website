# Bio

I am a tech writer, technical translator and language afficionada, living and working in Odder, Central Denmark. 

My goal is to help companies and organizations optimize their technical communication by providing great technical content. As a passionate language nerd, I focus on writing concise and clear texts that are nice to read and easy to understand. 

I have successfully helped companies and organizations in the health software, first aid, educational, and technical hardware sectors with technical writing and translation tasks. 

These include:

    > Proof reading, editing, and quality management

    > Communication strategy and planning

    > SEO and technical copywriting

    > Translation of medical software

    > Subtitling 

    > Hardware documentation

    > Proposal writing for EU projects

Formally, I hold a master’s degree in Chinese and German Studies and have spent years teaching and translating these languages. 

As a tech writer, however, I mostly work with the language combination English – Danish. 

When I am not trying to coordinate the chaotic hubbub that is everyday life with a husband and two children, I am an avid practitioner of aikido, archery, and open water swimming.
