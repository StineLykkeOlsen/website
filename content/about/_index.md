# Bio
My journey towards becoming a technical writer and translator started in 2005 when I had my first job editing and proof reading a translation for a Danish First Aid Company. For the last couple of decades I have worked as a translator, writer, and language teacher. In 2022, however, I decided to take the leap and become an independent technical writer and translator.

My goal is to help companies and organizations optimize their technical communication by providing great technical content. In my personal and professional life I strive to adhere to my core values:

/# Be quality conscious
/# Be reliable and trustworthy
/# Be genuine, respectful, and kind

I have successfully helped companies and organizations in the health software, first aid, educational, and technical hardware sectors with technical writing and translation tasks. 

# These include:

    > Proof reading, editing, and quality management

    > Communication strategy and planning

    > SEO and technical copywriting

    > Translation of medical software

    > Subtitling 

    > Hardware documentation

    > Proposal writing for EU projects

Formally, I hold a master’s degree in Chinese and German Studies, and I have spent years teaching and translating these languages. 

As a tech writer, however, I mostly work with the language combination English – Danish.

When I am not trying to coordinate the chaotic hubbub that is everyday life with a husband and two children, I am an avid practitioner of aikido, archery, and open water swimming.
