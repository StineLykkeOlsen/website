I am a tech writer, technical translator and language afficionada, living and working in Odder, Central Denmark. 

I have created this portfolio website showcase my experiences and skills in the fields of technical writing and technical translation. 

To reflect my professional values, I write a bit about my philosophy towards writing and translation - and the importance of high-quality technical communication. 

I am open to collaboration with companies and organisation all over the world. Don't hesitate to reach out here or visit me on LinkedIn / GitHub.
