I am a tech writer, technical translator and language afficionada, living and working in Odder, Central Denmark. 

My portfolio website showcases my experiences and skills in the fields of technical writing and technical translation. 

To reflect my professional values, I write a bit about my philosophy towards writing and translation - and the importance of high-quality technical communication.
