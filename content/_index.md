Hi, there!

I am a tech writer, technical translator and language afficionada, living and working in Odder, Central Denmark. 

I have created this portfolio website to showcase my experiences and skills in the fields of technical writing and technical translation. 

To reflect my professional values, I write a bit about my philosophy towards writing and translation - and the importance of high-quality technical communication. 

I am open to collaboration with companies and organisations all over the world. Don't hesitate to reach out by e-mail or visit my profile pages on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/stinelykkeolsen) / [GitHub](https://github.com/StineLykkeOlsen).
